NEVER EVER run git commit or git push. Do not make new docs unless I ask you to. Never put anything that will be flagged by git defender in tracked files. Never point sensitive endpoints, account names, account ids, etc in tracked files. For example .envs, always use YOUR_XYZ format with all caps and snake case. Whenever we need to create aws resources, create a .sh script to do so with CLI which utilizes creds sourced in shell. Do not hardcode endpoints, creds, etc. in .sh scripts.
